# Traffic plotting python script

This script uses google maps traffic data to generate a plot of how long it 
take to get from a start address to an end address during certain rush hour
periods. Once the rush hour periods are over a graph is created and saved
to visualize how the traffic changes with time. In order to use this script
you must have a google maps API key as well as Matplotlib and NumPy and 
the google maps python library. Paste your google maps API key into the 
script where directed and also enter the start and end addresses where
directed. You can edit the hours during which the script collects data
by editing the am and pm arrays.
